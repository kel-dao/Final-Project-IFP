        <h4>Anti Anxiety Series Week 7</h4>
        <h5>June 5, 2017</h5>
        <p align="center"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/puHOOOW63Iw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
        <p>Week 7 and another 20 minute workout for you! This week I keep it to body weight but focus a little more strength training. I think by now you know I'm a big fan of strength training for the badassery boost it gives you. But what about the other benefits? Well lets touch on a few. Strength training can boost your mood with the release of endorphins (the feel good chemical in your brain), build bone strength and help prevent osteoporosis, boost energy and improve sleep, improve balance and coordination, help maintain a healthy weight, aid in weight loss, and boost muscle mass which increases your metabolism and burns more calories throughout the day (this means more ice cream for you)</p>
        <p>And that is just the beginning of what strength training can do you for. Not convinced? Try this workout 3 times a week for 1 month and see the changes. As always the goal is to move your body, feel good and have fun. Enjoy and I've got one more workout coming to you this week! Happy moving.</p>
        <p>xoxo, Anna</p>

        <h4>Anti Anxiety Series Week 5</h4>
        <h5>April 27, 2015</h5>
        <p align="center"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/29JiDuPU6Zk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
        <p> Week 5 of #LIFTINGyourmood is here. This week we are talking all about morning rituals. Do you have one? I used to wake up with intense anxiety, have a cup of coffee, hop on my email and social media page and then hope that my anxiety magically would go away. Turns out all 3 of those morning activities just caused me more stress. So I created a morning routine.</p>
        <p>The most successful and prolific people have morning routines so crossing my fingers my routine turns me into OPRAH. Hey, a lady can dream. Some of my favorite routines I read about were Richard Branson, founder of the Virgin Group, swims around is island or goes kite surfing then plays tennis before sitting down for a healthy breakfast. Or Simon Cowell who apparently resets the snooze button twice before being served a breakfast of hot water with lemon, papaya juice with lime, oatmeal, tea and 3 smoothies.WHY DO YOU NEED 3 SMOOTHIES SIMON COWELL?</p>
        <p>Now we all can't own a private island or have 3 breakfasts hand delivered to us but we can create our own unique and nourishing morning rituals that start us off on the right foot. So here is what I do.No email or social media until after I do the following: 5 minutes meditation, 5 minutes emotional mapping, 5 minutes stretching/yoga</p>
        <p>xoxo, Anna</p>
