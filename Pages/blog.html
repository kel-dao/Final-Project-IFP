        <h4>Anti Anxiety Series Week 7</h4>
        <p align="center"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/puHOOOW63Iw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
        <p>Week 7 and another 20 minute workout for you! This week I keep it to body weight but focus a little more strength training. I think by now you know I'm a big fan of strength training for the badassery boost it gives you. But what about the other benefits? Well lets touch on a few. Strength training can boost your mood with the release of endorphins (the feel good chemical in your brain), build bone strength and help prevent osteoporosis, boost energy and improve sleep, improve balance and coordination, help maintain a healthy weight, aid in weight loss, and boost muscle mass which increases your metabolism and burns more calories throughout the day (this means more ice cream for you)</p>
        <p>And that is just the beginning of what strength training can do you for. Not convinced? Try this workout 3 times a week for 1 month and see the changes. As always the goal is to move your body, feel good and have fun. Enjoy and I've got one more workout coming to you this week! Happy moving.</p>
        <p>xoxo, Anna</p>
