    <p>"This is a call to arms. A call to be gentle, to be forgiving, to be generous with yourself. The next time you look into the mirror, try to let go of the story line that says you're too fat or too sallow, too ashy or too old, your eyes are too small or your nose too big; just look into the mirror and see your face. When the criticism drops away, what you will see then is just you, without judgment, and that is the first step toward transforming your experience of the world.‚Äù</p>

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <img class="about" alt="bio pic" src="AnnaBio.jpg">
    <p>I'm Anna. I'm a proud Pacific Northwesterner and I I love a good workout, a good belly laugh and a good dessert. I'm an actor and singer and run an in home personal training business and spend as much time as possible with family, friends and my dog son Westley.</p> 

    <p>I discovered my love of fitness about 6 years ago. I have struggled with anxiety, depression and trichotillomania for 15 year and it was the summer in between my junior and senior year of college when I found myself living at home, unhealthy and unhappy. Desperate for a solution I signed up for a local gym and walked into a Bodypump class. That class saved my life. The instructor was a walking badass, she was strong, confident, joyful and full of energy. She embodied everything I wanted to be, so I kept coming back and in 3 months I had transformed my body but I also transformed my mind. I fell completely in love with weightlifting and for the first time I felt both externally AND internally strong. That transformation inspired my journey as a fitness instructor and eventually a personal trainer.</p>

    <p>I'm an NSCA Certified Personal Trainer and group fitness instructor and love strength training, TRX, yoga, circuit training and kettlebells. I am a warrior of body acceptance and self love. As an actor and model I use exercises as a part of my daily practice to help me chose gratitude and love of my body. Its hard. We are drowning in messages that tell us that we are not enough, but I think life is too short to be at war with ourselves so here is my journey to live to move and to love.</p>
